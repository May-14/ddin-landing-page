This project is a big step up from anything I have ever done so far. Basically it's a culmination of all the skills I have learned so far. Html, css and flexbox. This is my second project with the Odin Project. For this project I had to recreate a website based on an image we were given alongside some information about fonts and colors. Finally playing around with flexbox, seeing how it made my designs able to adapt to different screen sizes and how easy it was to position elements where I wanted them was worth all the struggle it tool to learn it. This project was hard, but also a huge learning experience.
